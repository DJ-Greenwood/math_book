    "Chapter 1: The Foundation of All Math – Addition and Subtraction\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "1.1 Why Start Here?\n",
    "Addition and subtraction are the building blocks of all mathematical concepts. If we think of math as a language, then addition and subtraction are the alphabet—simple yet powerful tools that help us solve problems, from everyday tasks to complex equations.\n",
    "Let’s begin by understanding these basic operations deeply. Whether you’re managing your budget, dividing something between friends, or calculating distances, these two operations are always at play.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "1.2 What Is Addition?\n",
    "Addition is the process of combining two or more numbers to get a larger number. Think of it like this:\n",
    "•\tIf you have 3 apples and someone gives you 2 more apples, how many apples do you have in total?\n",
    "This problem is an example of addition: 3 apples + 2 apples = 5 apples.\n",
    "Let’s look at some other simple examples:\n",
    "•\t1 + 1 = 2\n",
    "•\t4 + 3 = 7\n",
    "•\t10 + 20 = 30\n",
    "Addition works by combining. You start with one number, and as you add more numbers, the total grows.\n",
    "Visualizing Addition: One of the best ways to understand addition is by using a number line. A number line is a straight line where numbers increase as you move to the right. To add, you simply move to the right by the number you're adding.\n",
    "For example, if you’re adding 2 + 3, you can start at 2 on the number line and move 3 steps to the right. You’ll land at 5.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "1.3 What Is Subtraction?\n",
    "Subtraction is the process of taking one number away from another. If addition is about combining, subtraction is about removing.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "•\tYou have 5 apples, and you give 2 away. How many apples are left?\n",
    "This is subtraction: 5 apples - 2 apples = 3 apples.\n",
    "Other simple examples:\n",
    "•\t7 - 4 = 3\n",
    "•\t10 - 5 = 5\n",
    "•\t15 - 9 = 6\n",
    "Subtraction helps us find out how much is left or how much we need to remove from something.\n",
    "Visualizing Subtraction: We can also use a number line for subtraction. Instead of moving to the right as we do with addition, we move to the left.\n",
    "If you’re subtracting 5 - 2, you start at 5 on the number line and move 2 steps to the left. You’ll land at 3.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "1.4 Practice Makes Perfect: Let’s Try Some Exercises!\n",
    "Simple Addition:\n",
    "1.\t5 + 4 = ____\n",
    "2.\t7 + 2 = ____\n",
    "3.\t10 + 6 = ____\n",
    "Simple Subtraction:\n",
    "1.\t8 - 3 = ____\n",
    "2.\t12 - 5 = ____\n",
    "3.\t20 - 9 = ____\n",
    "Try to use a number line for these problems. Draw one out, and for each addition problem, move right. For each subtraction problem, move left. This will help you visualize the process.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "1.5 Making It Real: Addition and Subtraction in Everyday Life\n",
    "Math is everywhere. You use addition and subtraction more often than you think:\n",
    "•\tShopping: You bought 3 oranges and added 2 apples to your basket. How many pieces of fruit do you have? That’s 3 + 2 = 5!\n",
    "•\tCooking: You have 4 cups of flour, but your recipe only calls for 2 cups. How much flour will you have left after using what you need? That’s 4 - 2 = 2 cups left.\n",
    "•\tTraveling: You traveled 15 miles, but your destination is 20 miles away. How many miles are left to go? That’s 20 - 15 = 5 miles left.\n",
    "Addition and subtraction help you organize, plan, and make decisions in your daily life.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "1.6 The Properties of Addition and Subtraction\n",
    "Now that we’ve mastered the basics, let’s look at some important properties that will help us understand these operations even better:\n",
    "Commutative Property of Addition:\n",
    "•\tWhen adding two numbers, the order doesn’t matter.\n",
    "•\tFor example, 3 + 5 is the same as 5 + 3. Both equal 8.\n",
    "Associative Property of Addition:\n",
    "•\tWhen adding three or more numbers, it doesn’t matter how you group them.\n",
    "•\tFor example, (2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4). Both equal 9.\n",
    "Subtraction is not Commutative:\n",
    "•\tUnlike addition, the order does matter in subtraction.\n",
    "•\tFor example, 5 - 3 is not the same as 3 - 5. One equals 2, and the other equals -2.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "1.7 Breaking It Down: How to Approach Word Problems\n",
    "One of the most important ways math shows up in real life is through word problems. Word problems take a real-world situation and ask you to solve it with math.\n",
    "Here’s a simple strategy to help you:\n",
    "1.\tRead the problem carefully.\n",
    "2.\tIdentify what you’re being asked to find.\n",
    "3.\tTranslate the words into numbers (e.g., “two more” means +2).\n",
    "4.\tWrite down the math problem.\n",
    "5.\tSolve it!\n",
    "Let’s try an example:\n",
    "Problem: Sarah has 5 marbles. She finds 3 more marbles. How many marbles does Sarah have now?\n",
    "Step 1: Identify what we know.\n",
    "•\tSarah starts with 5 marbles.\n",
    "•\tShe finds 3 more.\n",
    "Step 2: Write the math problem:\n",
    "•\t5 + 3 = 8.\n",
    "Step 3: Solve it. Sarah now has 8 marbles.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "1.8 Chapter Summary\n",
    "•\tAddition is about combining numbers to get a larger total.\n",
    "•\tSubtraction is about removing numbers to see how much is left.\n",
    "•\tWe can use number lines to help visualize both operations.\n",
    "•\tThese operations are useful in everyday life, from shopping to cooking and traveling.\n",
    "•\tWe learned the commutative and associative properties for addition and why subtraction doesn’t have these properties.\n",
    "Mastering addition and subtraction will set the stage for learning more advanced math concepts in the next chapters. Keep practicing, and soon you’ll be ready for the next step: multiplication and division!\n",

    "________________________________________\n",
    "2.1 Introduction: The Power of Groups and Sharing\n",
    "Now that you’ve mastered addition and subtraction, you’re ready to take the next step: multiplication and division. These two operations are closely related to addition and subtraction but allow us to work with much larger numbers more efficiently.\n",
    "Multiplication is about grouping, while division is about sharing or splitting things equally. You’ll find these concepts useful for everything from grocery shopping to splitting up a pizza with friends.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "2.2 What Is Multiplication?\n",
    "Multiplication is a shortcut for adding the same number several times. For example, if you want to find the total number of apples in 4 baskets, with each basket containing 3 apples, you could either add or multiply:\n",
    "•\t3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 (This is adding four 3’s.)\n",
    "•\tOr you could multiply: 4 × 3 = 12 (This gives the same result in one step!)\n",
    "Here’s how it works:\n",
    "•\t4 × 3 means \"4 groups of 3.\"\n",
    "Just like addition, multiplication allows us to combine numbers, but it’s much faster when you’re working with larger numbers or repeated amounts.\n",
    "Visualizing Multiplication: We can visualize multiplication using arrays or grids. Imagine you’re arranging objects in rows and columns:\n",
    "•\tIf you have 4 rows of 3 objects, you can count all the objects (3 + 3 + 3 + 3) or multiply (4 × 3 = 12).\n",
    "Let’s try another example:\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "•\tHow many total buttons do you have if you arrange them in 5 rows with 6 buttons in each row?\n",
    "•\tInstead of adding 6 five times, multiply: 5 × 6 = 30 buttons.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "2.3 What Is Division?\n",
    "Division is the reverse of multiplication. It’s used to split a total into equal parts or to see how many times one number can fit into another. For example:\n",
    "•\tYou have 12 candies and want to share them equally among 4 friends. How many candies does each friend get?\n",
    "This is a division problem:\n",
    "•\t12 ÷ 4 = 3 (Each friend gets 3 candies.)\n",
    "Here’s how it works:\n",
    "•\t12 ÷ 4 means \"How many groups of 4 can I make from 12?\"\n",
    "Visualizing Division: We can also use arrays and grouping to understand division. Imagine you have 12 candies, and you want to put them into groups of 4. You would end up with 3 groups of 4, which tells you that 12 ÷ 4 = 3.\n",
    "Another example:\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "•\tYou have 20 pieces of pizza, and you want to split them between 5 people. How many slices does each person get?\n",
    "•\tDivide: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 slices per person.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "2.4 The Relationship Between Multiplication and Division\n",
    "Multiplication and division are opposite operations, and they are closely related. This means if you know how to multiply, you can use that knowledge to help you divide.\n",
    "For example, if you know that 4 × 3 = 12, you also know:\n",
    "•\t12 ÷ 4 = 3\n",
    "•\t12 ÷ 3 = 4\n",
    "This is called the inverse relationship between multiplication and division. When you multiply two numbers to get a product, division allows you to work backwards from that product to find one of the original numbers.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "•\tIf 7 × 8 = 56, then:\n",
    "o\t56 ÷ 7 = 8\n",
    "o\t56 ÷ 8 = 7\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "2.5 Practice Makes Perfect: Let’s Try Some Exercises!\n",

    "2.\t5 × 6 = ____\n",
    "3.\t8 × 7 = ____\n",
    "Simple Division:\n",
    "1.\t12 ÷ 4 = ____\n",
    "2.\t20 ÷ 5 = ____\n",
    "3.\t36 ÷ 6 = ____\n",
    "Remember, multiplication is repeated addition, and division is splitting into equal parts. Practice using these operations with real objects, such as grouping items or dividing things equally among friends.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "2.6 Everyday Examples of Multiplication and Division\n",
    "Just like addition and subtraction, multiplication and division show up in everyday life. Let’s look at some examples:\n",
    "•\tCooking: If a recipe calls for 3 eggs and you’re doubling the recipe, you’ll multiply: 3 × 2 = 6 eggs.\n",
    "•\tShopping: You’re buying 5 packs of juice, and each pack has 6 bottles. To find the total number of bottles, multiply: 5 × 6 = 30 bottles.\n",
    "•\tSplitting Costs: You and 3 friends are splitting the cost of a $40 meal equally. To find out how much each person should pay, divide: 40 ÷ 4 = 10.\n",

    "2.7 The Properties of Multiplication\n",
    "Just like with addition, multiplication has some useful properties:\n",
    "Commutative Property of Multiplication:\n",

    "•\tFor example, 3 × 5 is the same as 5 × 3. Both equal 15.\n",
    "Associative Property of Multiplication:\n",
    "•\tWhen multiplying three or more numbers, the way you group them doesn’t change the result.\n",
    "•\tFor example, (2 × 3) × 4 = 2 × (3 × 4). Both equal 24.\n",
    "Distributive Property:\n",
    "•\tYou can break up multiplication over addition.\n",

    "________________________________________\n",
    "3.1 Introduction: Why Learn About Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages?\n",
    "In the previous chapters, you learned about whole numbers and how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide them. But not everything in life comes in whole numbers. Sometimes, we need to talk about parts of things. This is where fractions, decimals, and percentages come in.\n",
    "Whether you’re measuring ingredients in a recipe, calculating a sale discount, or sharing a pizza with friends, you’re dealing with parts of a whole. These concepts are essential in daily life and will help you tackle more complex math problems down the road.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "3.2 What Is a Fraction?\n",
    "A fraction is a way to represent parts of a whole. It’s made up of two parts:\n",
    "•\tThe numerator (the top number) tells you how many parts you have.\n",
    "•\tThe denominator (the bottom number) tells you how many equal parts the whole is divided into.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "•\tIn the fraction ½, the numerator is 1, and the denominator is 2. This means we have 1 part out of 2 equal parts, or \"one-half.\"\n",
    "•\tIn the fraction ¾, the numerator is 3, and the denominator is 4. This means we have 3 parts out of 4 equal parts, or \"three-quarters.\"\n",
    "Visualizing Fractions: You can picture fractions by thinking of a pie or pizza. Imagine cutting a pizza into 4 equal slices. Each slice is ¼ of the pizza. If you eat 2 slices, you’ve eaten 2 out of 4 parts, or 2/4 of the pizza (which simplifies to ½).\n",
    "Key Vocabulary:\n",
    "•\tProper fraction: The numerator is smaller than the denominator (e.g., 3/4).\n",
    "•\tImproper fraction: The numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator (e.g., 5/4).\n",
    "•\tMixed number: A whole number combined with a fraction (e.g., 1 ½).\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "3.3 What Is a Decimal?\n",
    "A decimal is another way to represent parts of a whole, especially when working with the base-10 number system. Decimals are often used in money, measurements, and scientific data.\n",
    "Understanding Place Value in Decimals: Just as whole numbers have place values (ones, tens, hundreds, etc.), decimals have place values for parts smaller than one:\n",
    "•\t0.1 is one-tenth.\n",
    "•\t0.01 is one-hundredth.\n",
    "•\t0.001 is one-thousandth.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "•\t0.5 means 5 tenths (or ½), so it’s half of 1.\n",
    "•\t0.75 means 75 hundredths (or ¾), so it’s three-quarters of 1.\n",
    "Converting Fractions to Decimals: We can convert fractions to decimals by dividing the numerator by the denominator. For example:\n",
    "•\t½ = 1 ÷ 2 = 0.5\n",
    "•\t¾ = 3 ÷ 4 = 0.75\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "3.4 What Is a Percentage?\n",
    "A percentage is a way to describe parts of a whole using 100 as the reference point. It’s essentially a fraction out of 100. Percentages are extremely useful in everyday life, especially for things like discounts, taxes, and grades.\n",
    "Understanding Percentages:\n",
    "•\t50% means 50 out of 100, or half.\n",
    "•\t25% means 25 out of 100, or one-quarter.\n",

    "4.1 Introduction: The Power of Variables and Equations\n",
    "In the previous chapters, we explored numbers, fractions, decimals, and percentages. Now, we are ready to enter the world of algebra. Algebra may seem intimidating at first, but it's simply a way of using letters and symbols to represent numbers and relationships between them.\n",
    "Why is algebra important? Because it allows us to solve problems where we don't know all the information yet. Whether you're calculating the price of multiple items, planning how to save money, or figuring out how far you've traveled, algebra helps you break these problems down and find solutions.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "4.2 What Is a Variable?\n",
    "A variable is a symbol (often a letter) that represents a number we don’t know yet. Think of it as a blank space that will eventually be filled in.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "•\tIf you don’t know how many apples you have, you can use x to represent the number of apples.\n",
    "Here’s how it looks:\n",
    "•\t\"I have x apples.\"\n",
    "Using Variables in Equations: You can use variables to create equations, which are like math sentences that describe relationships between numbers.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "•\tYou buy 3 apples, and you already had x apples. The equation would look like this:\n",
    "o\tx + 3 (This means \"the number of apples I already had plus 3 more apples.\")\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "4.3 What Is an Equation?\n",
    "An equation is a statement that two things are equal. It has two sides, usually with an equal sign (=) in the middle.\n",
    "Here’s an example:\n",
    "•\tx + 3 = 7\n",
    "This equation says that if you add 3 to some unknown number x, you will get 7.\n",
    "Your job in algebra is often to solve the equation—to figure out what number x represents.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "4.4 Solving Simple Equations\n",
    "The key to solving equations is to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. Let’s go back to the equation x + 3 = 7.\n",
    "Step 1: Subtract 3 from both sides.\n",
    "•\tWhy? Because you want to get x by itself.\n",
    "•\tx + 3 - 3 = 7 - 3\n",
    "Step 2: Simplify.\n",
    "•\tx = 4\n",
    "Now, we know that x equals 4. This means you originally had 4 apples before buying 3 more.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "4.5 Understanding Patterns and Relationships\n",
    "Algebra is also about recognizing patterns and relationships between numbers. For example, if you know that the number of apples increases by 3 every day, you could describe this pattern with an equation.\n",
    "Let’s say:\n",
    "•\tx represents the number of apples you have.\n",
    "•\td represents the number of days.\n",
    "Each day, you get 3 more apples, so you can write:\n",

    "6.4 What Is Probability?\n",
    "Probability is the study of how likely something is to happen. It’s a way of measuring uncertainty. The probability of an event can range from 0 to 1:\n",
    "•\tA probability of 0 means the event is impossible (it will never happen).\n",
    "•\tA probability of 1 means the event is certain (it will definitely happen).\n",
    "•\tAny probability between 0 and 1 reflects varying levels of likelihood.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "•\tIf you're flipping a coin, there are two possible outcomes: heads or tails.\n",
    "•\tSince the coin is fair, each outcome has an equal probability of happening:\n",
    "o\tThe probability of getting heads is ½ or 0.5.\n",
    "o\tThe probability of getting tails is also ½ or 0.5.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "6.5 Calculating Probability\n",
    "The basic formula for probability is:\n",
    "Probability of an event=Number of favorable outcomesTotal number of possible outcomes\\text{Probability of an event} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}Probability of an event=Total number of possible outcomesNumber of favorable outcomes\n",
    "Example 1: Rolling a Die\n",
    "If you roll a standard six-sided die, the probability of rolling a 4 is:\n",
    "•\tFavorable outcome: 1 (only one side of the die has a 4).\n",
    "•\tTotal possible outcomes: 6 (since the die has six sides).\n",
    "Probability of rolling a 4=16\\text{Probability of rolling a 4} = \\frac{1}{6}Probability of rolling a 4=61\n",
    "Example 2: Drawing a Card\n",
    "If you draw one card from a standard deck of 52 cards, the probability of drawing a heart is:\n",
    "•\tFavorable outcomes: 13 (since there are 13 hearts in a deck).\n",
    "•\tTotal possible outcomes: 52.\n",
    "Probability of drawing a heart=1352=14\\text{Probability of drawing a heart} = \\frac{13}{52} = \\frac{1}{4}Probability of drawing a heart=5213=41\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "6.6 Complementary and Independent Events\n",
    "Complementary Events:\n",
    "Complementary events are two events where one must happen, and the other cannot. For example, when flipping a coin, you either get heads or tails, but not both. The probability of the two events adds up to 1.\n",
    "If the probability of an event is P, then the probability of its complement (the event not happening) is:\n",
    "Probability of complement=1−P\\text{Probability of complement} = 1 - PProbability of complement=1−P\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "•\tIf the probability of rain tomorrow is 0.3, the probability that it will not rain is:\n",
    "o\t1 - 0.3 = 0.7 or 70%.\n",
    "Independent Events:\n",
    "Independent events are events where the outcome of one does not affect the outcome of the other. For example, rolling a die and flipping a coin are independent events because the result of the die does not impact the coin flip.\n",
    "For independent events, the probability of both events happening is the product of their individual probabilities.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "•\tIf the probability of rolling a 6 on a die is 1/6, and the probability of flipping heads on a coin is 1/2, the probability of both rolling a 6 and flipping heads is: Probability of both=16×12=112\\text{Probability of both} = \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{12}Probability of both=61×21=121\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "6.7 Making Predictions with Probability\n",
    "Probability helps us make predictions about future events based on past data or known probabilities.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "•\tIf you know that the chance of rain tomorrow is 60%, you might decide to bring an umbrella because the probability suggests that it’s more likely to rain than not.\n",

    "1.\tMean (Average): Add up all the numbers and divide by how many numbers there are.\n",
    "o\tExample: The mean of 2, 4, 6, and 8 is: 2+4+6+84=5\\frac{2 + 4 + 6 + 8}{4} = 542+4+6+8=5\n",
    "2.\tMedian: The middle number in a sorted list.\n",
    "o\tExample: The median of 1, 3, and 5 is 3 (because 3 is in the middle).\n",
    "3.\tMode: The number that appears most often.\n",

    "________________________________________\n",
    "8.1 Introduction: Understanding Change Over Time\n",
    "Calculus is the branch of mathematics that focuses on change. While algebra helps us solve for unknown values and geometry deals with shapes and spaces, calculus answers questions about how things change over time, how fast things move, or how quantities accumulate.\n",
    "Don’t let the idea of calculus intimidate you! At its core, calculus is simply a way of understanding rates of change and accumulation. Whether it’s predicting the speed of a car, calculating areas under curves, or modeling population growth, calculus provides the tools to solve these kinds of problems.\n",
    "In this chapter, we’ll explore the basics of derivatives and integrals, the two main concepts of calculus, and how they help us describe change and motion.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "8.2 What Is a Derivative?\n",
    "A derivative tells us how a function is changing at any given point. It measures the rate of change or the slope of a curve at a specific point. In simpler terms, it answers questions like:\n",
    "•\tHow fast is a car moving at a specific moment?\n",
    "•\tHow quickly is the population growing?\n",
    "The Concept of Slope:\n",
    "In algebra, the slope of a line is a measure of its steepness, and it tells us how fast one variable changes with respect to another. In calculus, the slope is used to describe the instantaneous rate of change of a function.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "•\tFor a linear function like f(x)=2x+3f(x) = 2x + 3f(x)=2x+3, the slope is constant. The derivative of this function is 2, meaning the rate of change is the same no matter where you are on the line.\n",
    "But what happens when the function isn’t a straight line? For functions that curve, like f(x)=x2f(x) = x^2f(x)=x2, the slope (or rate of change) varies depending on the point. The derivative helps us figure out the slope at any point along the curve.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "8.3 Finding Derivatives\n",
    "The derivative of a function is found using rules that make the process easier. These rules simplify how we calculate the rate of change for different types of functions.\n",

    "2.\tConstant Rule: The derivative of a constant is always 0. This is because a constant does not change, so its rate of change is 0.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "o\tFor f(x)=7f(x) = 7f(x)=7, the derivative is f′(x)=0f'(x) = 0f′(x)=0.\n",

    "Interpreting Derivatives:\n",

    "2.\tOptimization: Businesses use derivatives to find maximum profits or minimum costs. By taking the derivative of a profit or cost function, companies can determine when profits are at their highest or when costs are at their lowest.\n",
    "3.\tTangent Lines: The derivative of a function at a point gives the slope of the tangent line to the curve at that point. A tangent line is a straight line that touches the curve at exactly one point and represents the best linear approximation of the curve near that point.\n",

In this chapter, we’ll take a closer look at the building blocks of mathematical reasoning and the tools mathematicians use to demonstrate whether something is true or false.\n",
    "Logic, sets, and proofs may seem abstract at first, but they are powerful tools for solving problems and understanding the structure of mathematics itself. Whether you're proving a theorem, analyzing data, or coding a computer algorithm, these ideas are key to thinking clearly and solving problems systematically.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "10.2 What Is Logic?\n",
    "Logic is the study of reasoning. In math, logic helps us determine whether statements are true or false and how to combine these statements to make new conclusions.\n",
    "Logical Statements:\n",
    "A statement in logic is a sentence that is either true or false. For example:\n",
    "•\t\"2 + 2 = 4\" is a true statement.\n",
    "•\t\"5 is greater than 10\" is a false statement.\n",
    "We often use symbols to represent logical statements:\n",
    "•\tp might represent \"2 + 2 = 4.\"\n",
    "•\tq might represent \"5 is greater than 10.\"\n",
    "Logical Operations:\n",
    "We can combine logical statements using logical operations, such as:\n",
    "1.\tAND ( ∧ ): Both statements must be true for the combined statement to be true.\n",
    "o\tFor example, \"p ∧ q\" means \"p AND q.\"\n",
    "o\tIf p is true and q is false, \"p ∧ q\" is false.\n",
    "2.\tOR ( ∨ ): If at least one of the statements is true, the combined statement is true.\n",

    "Types of Proofs:\n",
    "1.\tDirect Proof: You start with known facts and use logical steps to arrive at the conclusion.\n",
    "Example: Prove that if nnn is an even number, then n2n^2n2 is even.\n",
    "o\tProof: If nnn is even, we can write n=2kn = 2kn=2k for some integer kkk.\n",

    "2.\tProof by Contradiction: You assume the opposite of what you're trying to prove, show that this leads to a contradiction, and conclude that the original statement must be true.\n",
    "Example: Prove that there is no largest prime number.\n",

    "o\tBase Case: Prove that the statement is true for the first value (often n=1n = 1n=1).\n",
    "o\tInductive Step: Assume the statement is true for some n=kn = kn=k and then prove it is true for n=k+1n = k + 1n=k+1.\n",
    "Example: Prove that the sum of the first nnn natural numbers is n(n+1)2\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}2n(n+1).\n",
    "o\tBase Case: For n=1n = 1n=1, the sum is 1, which matches 1(1+1)2=1\\frac{1(1+1)}{2} = 121(1+1)=1.\n",
    "o\tInductive Step: Assume the formula holds for n=kn = kn=k, meaning: 1+2+⋯+k=k(k+1)21 + 2 + \\dots + k = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}1+2+⋯+k=2k(k+1) Now prove it for n=k+1n = k + 1n=k+1: 1+2+⋯+k+(k+1)=k(k+1)2+(k+1)=(k+1)(k+2)21 + 2 + \\dots + k + (k+1) = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1) = \\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}1+2+⋯+k+(k+1)=2k(k+1)+(k+1)=2(k+1)(k+2) Therefore, the statement holds for n=k+1n = k+1n=k+1, completing the proof by induction.\n",

    "11.1 Introduction: Exploring the Concept of Infinity\n",
    "The idea of infinity is one of the most profound and mind-expanding concepts in mathematics. Unlike a regular number, infinity represents something that never ends or something that is larger than any number you can imagine. While infinity seems abstract, it is a central idea in many advanced math topics, from calculus to set theory and beyond.\n",
    "In this chapter, we will explore the concept of limits, which help us understand how numbers behave as they approach infinity (or other values). We will also explore other fascinating advanced topics related to infinity, such as infinite sequences, series, and the nature of different \"sizes\" of infinity.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "11.2 What Is a Limit?\n",
    "In mathematics, a limit describes the value that a function or sequence \"approaches\" as the input (or index) gets closer to a certain point or as it heads toward infinity.\n",
    "Understanding Limits:\n",
    "A limit helps us answer questions like:\n",
    "•\t\"What happens to a function as xxx gets larger and larger?\"\n",
    "•\t\"What value does a function approach as xxx gets closer to a particular number?\"\n",
    "Example: Consider the function f(x)=1xf(x) = \\frac{1}{x}f(x)=x1. As xxx gets larger and larger, the value of f(x)f(x)f(x) gets closer to 0. We say:\n",
    "lim⁡x→∞1x=0\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{x} = 0x→∞limx1=0\n",
    "This means that as xxx approaches infinity, the value of f(x)f(x)f(x) approaches 0, but it never actually reaches 0.\n",
    "Left-Hand and Right-Hand Limits:\n",
    "Sometimes, we’re interested in how a function behaves as it approaches a specific value from the left or the right.\n",
    "•\tThe left-hand limit looks at how the function behaves as the input approaches from values smaller than the target value.\n",
    "•\tThe right-hand limit looks at how the function behaves as the input approaches from values larger than the target value.\n",
    "Example: For the function f(x)=1x−1f(x) = \\frac{1}{x-1}f(x)=x−11, we might ask what happens as xxx approaches 1 from both sides:\n",
    "lim⁡x→1−1x−1=−∞andlim⁡x→1+1x−1=∞\\lim_{x \\to 1^-} \\frac{1}{x-1} = -\\infty \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lim_{x \\to 1^+} \\frac{1}{x-1} = \\inftyx→1−limx−11=−∞andx→1+limx−11=∞\n",
    "This means that as xxx approaches 1 from the left, f(x)f(x)f(x) goes to negative infinity, and as xxx approaches from the right, f(x)f(x)f(x) goes to positive infinity.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "11.3 Understanding Infinite Sequences\n",
    "An infinite sequence is an ordered list of numbers that continues forever. Each number in the sequence is called a term, and the position of the term in the sequence is called its index.\n",
    "Example of an Infinite Sequence:\n",
    "Consider the sequence:\n",
    "1,12,13,14,…1, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\dots1,21,31,41,…\n",
    "This sequence continues indefinitely, and the general term for the sequence is 1n\\frac{1}{n}n1, where nnn is the index of the term.\n",
    "As nnn gets larger, the terms in the sequence get smaller, and we can use limits to describe this behavior:\n",
    "lim⁡n→∞1n=0\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} = 0n→∞limn1=0\n",
    "This means that as nnn approaches infinity, the terms in the sequence approach 0.\n",
    "Converging vs. Diverging Sequences:\n",
    "•\tA sequence converges if the terms get closer and closer to a particular value.\n",
    "•\tA sequence diverges if the terms do not approach a specific value and instead grow without bound or oscillate.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "•\tThe sequence 1n\\frac{1}{n}n1 converges to 0 as n→∞n \\to \\inftyn→∞.\n",

    "________________________________________\n",
    "11.4 What Is an Infinite Series?\n",
    "An infinite series is the sum of the terms of an infinite sequence. Just as with sequences, some series converge (add up to a finite value), while others diverge (grow without bound).\n",
    "Example of an Infinite Series:\n",
    "Consider the series:\n",
    "S=1+12+14+18+…S = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\dotsS=1+21+41+81+…\n",
    "This is called a geometric series because each term is a fixed fraction of the previous term. In this case, each term is half of the previous one.\n",
    "We can find the sum of this geometric series by using the formula:\n",
    "S=a1−rS = \\frac{a}{1 - r}S=1−ra\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "•\taaa is the first term,\n",

    "So, the sum of this infinite series is 2, meaning the series converges.\n",
    "Diverging Series:\n",
    "Not all infinite series converge. For example, the series:\n",
    "1+1+1+1+…1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + \\dots1+1+1+1+…\n",
    "clearly grows without bound, so it diverges.\n",

    "11.5 Understanding Asymptotes\n",
    "An asymptote is a line that a graph approaches but never touches. Asymptotes often appear in graphs of functions that involve infinity, helping us understand the behavior of a function as it gets closer to certain points or heads toward infinity.\n",
    "Vertical Asymptote:\n",
    "A vertical asymptote occurs when a function increases or decreases without bound as it approaches a specific x-value.\n",
    "Example: The function f(x)=1x−2f(x) = \\frac{1}{x-2}f(x)=x−21 has a vertical asymptote at x=2x = 2x=2, because the function approaches infinity as xxx gets closer to 2 from the right, and negative infinity as xxx approaches from the left.\n",
    "Horizontal Asymptote:\n",
    "A horizontal asymptote describes the behavior of a function as xxx heads toward infinity. It represents a value that the function gets closer to but never actually reaches.\n",
    "Example: For f(x)=1xf(x) = \\frac{1}{x}f(x)=x1, the horizontal asymptote is y=0y = 0y=0, because as x→∞x \\to \\inftyx→∞, the function approaches 0.\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "11.6 Different Sizes of Infinity\n",
    "One of the most surprising facts about infinity is that not all infinities are the same size! This concept was first explored by the mathematician Georg Cantor, who showed that some infinite sets are \"larger\" than others.\n",
    "Countable vs. Uncountable Infinity:\n",
    "•\tA set is countably infinite if its elements can be put in one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. For example, the set of all whole numbers {0,1,2,3,… }\\{0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}{0,1,2,3,…} is countably infinite.\n",
    "•\tA set is uncountably infinite if it cannot be listed in this way. For example, the set of all real numbers between 0 and 1 is uncountably infinite, meaning that this set is \"larger\" than the set of natural numbers.\n",

It explores shapes, spaces, and the relationships between them, extending into dimensions far beyond the 2D and 3D shapes we encounter in everyday life. In this chapter, we’ll dive into advanced geometry concepts, including non-Euclidean geometry, higher dimensions, and topology.\n",
