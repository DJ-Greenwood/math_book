\chapter{Algebra: Solving for the Unknown}
\section{Introduction to Algebra}
Algebra is the branch of math that deals with finding unknown values. We will explore basic algebraic equations and how to solve for variables.

\section{Linear Equations}
Linear equations involve variables raised to the first power. This section will explain how to solve and graph linear equations.

\section{Quadratic Equations}
Quadratic equations are more complex, involving variables squared. We will cover different methods of solving them, including factoring and using the quadratic formula.
