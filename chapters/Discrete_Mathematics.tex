\chapter{Discrete Mathematics – Graph Theory, Combinatorics, and Cryptography}

\section{Introduction: The Power of Discrete Mathematics}
Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are countable or distinct, such as integers, graphs, and logical statements. Unlike calculus, which deals with continuous change, discrete math focuses on things that are separate and unconnected.

In this chapter, we’ll explore graph theory, combinatorics, and cryptography—three key areas of discrete math that are essential in computer science, network design, and data security. Whether you’re analyzing social networks, designing algorithms, or protecting sensitive information, discrete math provides the tools to handle complex, structured data.

\section{Graph Theory: Understanding Networks}
Graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relationships between objects. Graphs are everywhere—from social networks and transportation systems to biological networks and the internet.

\subsection{What Is a Graph?}
A graph consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vertices (nodes)}: These represent objects or entities.
    \item \textbf{Edges (links)}: These represent the relationships or connections between the vertices.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Types of Graphs}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Undirected Graphs}: In an undirected graph, edges have no direction. The connection between two vertices goes both ways.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Example}: A social network where two people are friends would be represented by an undirected edge between them.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Directed Graphs (Digraphs)}: In a directed graph, edges have a direction, indicating a one-way relationship between two vertices.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Example}: A website linking to another site without being linked back is an example of a directed edge.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Weighted Graphs}: In a weighted graph, each edge has a weight or value associated with it, representing the strength or cost of the connection.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Example}: A transportation map where the weight of the edge represents the distance or time between two cities.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Common Terms in Graph Theory}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Path}: A sequence of edges connecting a sequence of vertices.
    \item \textbf{Cycle}: A path that starts and ends at the same vertex.
    \item \textbf{Degree}: The number of edges connected to a vertex.
    \item \textbf{Connected Graph}: A graph where there is a path between every pair of vertices.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Applications of Graph Theory}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Social Networks}: Graph theory is used to model relationships between individuals, groups, or organizations.
    \item \textbf{Computer Networks}: The internet is modeled as a graph, with computers or routers as vertices and connections as edges.
    \item \textbf{Routing Algorithms}: Algorithms like Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm use graph theory to find the quickest route between two points.
\end{itemize}

\section{Combinatorics: Counting and Arrangements}
Combinatorics is the branch of mathematics that deals with counting, arrangement, and combination of objects. It helps answer questions like "How many different ways can I arrange these items?" or "What’s the probability of drawing a specific hand in a card game?"

\subsection{Permutations}
A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order. The order of the objects matters in permutations.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Example}: How many ways can you arrange the letters A, B, and C?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There are 6 possible permutations: ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, and CBA.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The formula for finding the number of permutations of \( n \) distinct objects is:
\[ n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \dots \times 1 \]

For 3 objects (A, B, C):
\[ 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \]

\subsection{Combinations}
A combination is a selection of objects where the order does not matter.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Example}: How many ways can you choose 2 letters from A, B, and C?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There are 3 combinations: AB, AC, and BC.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The formula for combinations is:
\[ \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( n \) is the total number of objects,
    \item \( r \) is the number of objects being chosen.
\end{itemize}

For 3 objects, choosing 2:
\[ \binom{3}{2} = \frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = \frac{3 \times 2 \times 1}{2 \times 1 \times 1} = 3 \]

\subsection{Applications of Combinatorics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Probability}: Combinatorics is used to calculate probabilities in card games, lotteries, and dice rolls.
    \item \textbf{Cryptography}: Combinatorics helps in generating secure encryption keys by determining how many possible keys exist.
    \item \textbf{Optimization}: Combinatorics is used to solve problems in logistics, such as determining the most efficient way to deliver goods to multiple locations.
\end{itemize}

\section{Cryptography: Securing Information}
Cryptography is the science of securing communication by transforming information into a form that only authorized parties can understand. It plays a crucial role in data protection, online transactions, and privacy in the digital world.

\subsection{Encryption and Decryption}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Encryption} is the process of converting plaintext (readable data) into ciphertext (unreadable data) using an algorithm and a key.
    \item \textbf{Decryption} is the reverse process, turning ciphertext back into plaintext using the correct key.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Symmetric Encryption}: The same key is used for both encryption and decryption. Both the sender and receiver need access to the same key.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Example}: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Asymmetric Encryption}: Different keys are used for encryption and decryption. The encryption key is public, while the decryption key is private. This is also known as public-key cryptography.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Example}: RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm, often used to secure online transactions.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Hash Functions}
A hash function takes an input (or message) and produces a fixed-size string of bytes, typically a hash value or digest. Hash functions are used in many cryptographic applications, including password storage and data integrity verification.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Example}: The SHA-256 algorithm is a popular cryptographic hash function.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Applications of Cryptography}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Security}: Encryption ensures that sensitive information, like credit card details and personal data, is protected during transmission.
    \item \textbf{Digital Signatures}: Cryptography enables digital signatures, which verify the authenticity and integrity of messages, ensuring that data hasn’t been tampered with.
    \item \textbf{Blockchain Technology}: Cryptography is fundamental to blockchain, where it secures transactions and ensures the immutability of records.
\end{itemize}

\section{Algorithms in Graph Theory, Combinatorics, and Cryptography}
Many important algorithms are built upon the concepts from graph theory, combinatorics, and cryptography. These algorithms are used to solve real-world problems efficiently.

\subsection{Graph Theory Algorithms}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Dijkstra’s Algorithm}: Finds the shortest path between two vertices in a weighted graph.
    \item \textbf{Depth-First Search (DFS)}: Explores all vertices in a graph by following a path as deeply as possible before backtracking.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Combinatorics Algorithms}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Backtracking}: Used to generate all possible combinations or permutations of a set of objects, often used in puzzles like Sudoku.
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Programming}: Solves optimization problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems, widely used in route planning and scheduling.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Cryptography Algorithms}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{RSA Algorithm}: A public-key encryption algorithm used to secure sensitive data, especially in online communications.
    \item \textbf{Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange}: A method for two parties to securely share a secret key over an insecure channel.
\end{enumerate}
